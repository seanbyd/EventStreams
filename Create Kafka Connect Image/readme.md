These files can be used to create a KafkaConnect image.

# kafka-connect-mq-source-2.0.0

As there are many jar files, the sub-directory mq-source was created in my-plugins.

You will face problems if this structure is not followed.

# kafka-connect-mq-source-2.3.0

As there is only one jar file, there is no need for the mq-source subdirectory. All files can be placed in my-plugins.
