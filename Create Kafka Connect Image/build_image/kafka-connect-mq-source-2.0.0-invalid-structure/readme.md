This repo contains the structure where the MQ source connector doesn't contain the dependency files, and the dependency files have been downloaded.

This structure is invalid as the connector jar plus the dependency jar files are all in the my-plugins directory. When there are multiple files theny need to be placed in a subdirectory of the my-plugins directory.
